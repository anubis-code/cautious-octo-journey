# 3D MODEL DESCRIPTION

## WS2811 16 Inch Snowflake

Print one central body 6 arms, 12 side extensions and 6 half diamond shapes.

Parts connect to each other like a jigsawpuzzle. No glue needed.

Dont print to high a layer height because the tolerances are very tight. Print at .2 to prevent a lot of sanding.

-UPDATE-

As requested i have updated the file directory to also include a version of the arm that enables you to connect multiple flakes to eachother. If you want the multiconnect print the file named Flake_Multi-Connect_Arm.STL instead of the original one.

-UPDATE 2-
Added another arm that has 2 small holes on the end to either connect multiple together or use them as mounting holes (Zip-ties for example)
File is Flake - Arm inc. Mounting-holes.STL
